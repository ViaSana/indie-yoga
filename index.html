    heading: Where the Soul Meets the Sea, in Ocean Beach
    p1: >-
        Welcome to Indie Yoga, the first hot yoga studio of the Ocean Beach
        community in San Diego. Proud of our roots and committed to our mission,
        we offer a serene sanctuary amidst the vibrant buzz of the neighborhood.
    p2: >-
        Heat transforms â€” and in our hot yoga studio, it becomes an integral
        part of your journey. It intensifies each asana, elevates your practice,
        and amplifies the sense of calm and release.  At Indie Yoga, you're not
        stepping into a mere studio, but a home where every individual is
        cherished, every class is a collective journey, and every session brings
        you closer to your authentic self.
