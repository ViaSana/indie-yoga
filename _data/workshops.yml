- name: Deep Yin & Restore w/ Mae
  description: >-
    Think Yin Yoga, but with more of those nurturing hands-on adjustments and
    gentle massage we love so much. This is an invitation to deeply reset and
    nourish your body, mind and spirit, to influence your life beyond the mat.
    We will slow down, clarify intentions, reset with deep, gentle yin postures,
    and an option to share tea after.

    Bring a mat, journal and pillow.

- name: A Song of Fire & Ice
  description: >-
    Join John Jay for an amazing workshop, where we will hop out of the frying
    pan and into the fire of ice!

    The Yoga Sutras ask us to practice non-attachment, remembering the fluidity
    of life and our ever changing experiences. We will explore these teachings
    in the extremes of Hot Yoga and Ice Baths. With the power of breathwork and
    commitment we will strive to let go in the understanding that all things
    must pass, both pleasant and unpleasant. Let’s unlock our full potential and
    power, as we find comfort in the most uncomfortable of settings!

    Other benefits include: increased energy, better sleep, reduced stress
    levels, heightened focus and determination, stronger immune system, and
    increased will power.

    Hot Yoga/Breathwork/Ice Baths
