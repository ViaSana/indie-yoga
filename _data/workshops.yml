- name: March Madness Challenge
  description: >-
    We always seek to encourage our members to create a more consistent Yoga
    practice. That’s why we’re once again hosting our March Madness Challenge.
    With the support of the Indie community, we challenge you to come to your
    mat 30 times in 31 days! We want to further incentivize your commitment with
    prizes, to include: 5 class packages (to use or gift to a friend), Indie
    Merch, and a Manduka mat to one lucky winner!

    For this challenge, we’ll be offering our 1 month unlimited yoga pass at
    $120, down from $150, for the month of March. With no contract or commitment
    needed after the month. Use promo code, "MarchMadness" to unlock your
    discount.
