    Why Moan & Ohm? Often we try to fight the poses and our body, attempting to
    force ourselves into asana and deeper postures. When we do this 'trying' we
    create tension in the body and mind. - If we can start to experience
    pleasure while in the midst of bodily discomfort then our bodies will
    soften, relax and simply melt into the pose! From my experience there is
    about 30% more depth that can be gained by almost everyone simply by tapping
    into a mindset and bodyset of pleasure and relaxation. This is why moaning,
    chanting, and singing 'YES' while going deep into hip openers will allow you
    to access new planes of existence within your body and soul than ever
    before. Not only this but when you reprogram your body and mind to
    experience the stretching of your vessel as pleasure instead of pain, the
    whole world of yoga and possibility opens to you. xo, <3, M
