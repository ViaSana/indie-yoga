    practice. That’s why we’re once again hosting our March Madness Challenge.

    prizes, to include: 5 class packages (to use or gift to a friend), Indie
    Merch, and a Manduka mat to one lucky winner!

    For this challenge, we’ll be offering our 1 month unlimited yoga pass at
    $120, down from $150, for the month of March. With no contract or commitment
    needed after the month. Use promo code, "MarchMadness" to unlock your
    discount.
