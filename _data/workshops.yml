    New Moon Cacao Ceremony

    Join Alex for a night of cacao, embodied movement, manifestation, magic, and
    connection. We will start the Sagittarius new moon off with an In depth
    cacao ceremony and meditation where we drop into our bodies, deepest
    desires, journaling and learn about the ceremonial power and history of
    cacao. Following our cacao ceremony we will drop more into our bodies
    through a heated embodiment hatha flow. The last hour of this workshop we
    will be vision boarding our manifestations with extra charged energy on one
    of the most powerful new moons of the year. Expect collaging, sharing, and
    realigning with your vision with a supportive community. There is power in
    gathering to be witnessed and speaking your intentions into reality. We cant
    wait to guide you through a transformational evening to help you re align
    with what you want to create for yourself.
