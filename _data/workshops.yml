- name: 20 HR Yin Yoga Training w/Dani & Mae
  description: >-
    Imagine yourself being so resourceful that you can nourish your body,
    nervous system, mind, and energy on your own through the modality of Yin
    Yoga.


    Yin Yoga focuses on the often neglected parts of the body - the joints,
    tendons, and fascia. This program is an opportunity to prioritize moving
    slowly and calming the anxious, modern mind.


    This Yin Yoga training will provide you with the resources to understand
    meditation, anatomy and physiology, and the nadis and meridians within the
    practice of Yin. Whether you are hoping to teach Yin or a practitioner, this
    training will prepare you to create a Yin Yoga sequence of your own - backed
    by the knowledge of its history and benefits.
