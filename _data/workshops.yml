    Join John Jay for an amazing workshop, where we will hop out of the frying
    pan and into the fire of ice!

    The Yoga Sutras ask us to practice non-attachment, remembering the fluidity
    of life and our ever changing experiences. We will explore these teachings
    in the extremes of Hot Yoga and Ice Baths. With the power of breathwork and
    commitment we will strive to let go in the understanding that all things
    must pass, both pleasant and unpleasant. Let’s unlock our full potential and
    power, as we find comfort in the most uncomfortable of settings!

    Other benefits include: increased energy, better sleep, reduced stress
    levels, heightened focus and determination, stronger immune system, and
    increased will power.

- name: Ritmos del Cuerpo w/ Bruna
  description: >-
    Ritmos del Cuerpo (Rhythms of the Body) is a self-expression lab. It is an
    experimental-always-changing group dynamic, where we will meet as a
    community and use both spontaneous and directed movements to create unique
    senses of being and feeling.

    The moment we become adults and forget the joy of playing like a child is
    when we lose ourselves. Somewhere on the way, we forget an important part of
    who we are, the one that is not trying to make sense, that is not trying to
    fit in, to fix anything, that has no fear, no shame, no inhibition, and no
    judgement. We just are. We can express emotions freely, can be silly, can
    laugh then cry, can cry then laugh without looking for an explanation.

    Ritmos del Cuerpo is an individual and collective experience at the same
    time. It’s held in a group setting because, as social beings, there’s a lot
    of insights that can come from sharing an experience with other humans in a
    safe environment. By being who I am, I can inspire those around me to be who
    they are and vice versa. And it’s also individual because it’s an internal
    search, an internal process, and it’s unique for each person in the dynamic.

    We will focus on the body and let the mind take the passenger seat for a
    bit. We will breathe, dance, shake, scream, laugh, cry, run, jump, play
    percussive instruments, meditate… and see what comes from that – but with no
    expectations.

    We will start with a light stretch and then move our way out of our mats.
    Self-expression exercises will be intentional towards releasing stiffness
    (physical and mental). 

    Our exercises can sometimes lead us to some sort of catharsis. Catharsis is
    reached as a way to become aware of repressed feelings and allow them an
    outlet. Catharsis is an expression - it is just the reverse process of
    repression. 

    Bruna started leading group dynamics back in Brasil and wants to offer this
    experience as a gift to anyone who feels called. 

    We follow 3 major principles in our circles:

    Non-monetary (we don’t accept any kind of payment and/or tips).

    Non-judgmental (we encourage a full-accepting non-conclusive approach).

    Complete respect towards one another (we cultivate a safe space for everyone
    to flourish).

    Bring your mat and water.

- name: Kundalini Activation Process w/Alex
  description: >-
    Kundalini Activation is direct transmission of pure life force energy. It is
    a spiritual process of elevation, self-realization and awakening of your own
    divine energy. The Kundalini represents our infinite multi-dimensional
    potential. It is our inner Portal to All that is. When the power of your
    life force awakens, a complete rewiring begins: releasing all that does not
    serve you, activating all the gifts of your soul. During a Kundalini
    activation, I open the portal, creating a vortex of intensified light
    frequency. You simply open and welcome the experience fully. Through the
    shakti kundalini portal your system enters in resonance and starts to adjust
    to it naturally. Your vibration increases and you experience a return to the
    original harmony of your spiritual essence. This divine energy is incredibly
    intelligent and will purify and activate exactly what you need on a
    physical, energetic, spiritual, mental and emotional level.
