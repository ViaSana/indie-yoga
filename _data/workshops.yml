    Community Gathering at The Template this Thursday, 11/16, 6:00-9:00 PM 


    In light of recent events that have deeply affected our brothers and sisters
    in Palestine and Israel, it’s time for us to come together and make a
    positive impact. Our intention is to unite as a community, for a night of
    artistic expression and sound healing, to support one another.  


    All funds raised will be donated to The Palestinian Children’s Relief Fund
    and The Shiloh Israel Children’s Fund, to ensure that contributions made,
    will reach all innocent lives in need.  


    Suggested donnation, $15-$30+ (Venmo: @unityforhumanity)
