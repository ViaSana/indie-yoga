    An all-levels workshop for practitioners interested in learning the
    mechanics of balancing.  Any able-bodied person can learn to properly stack
    their joints to achieve these postures. We’ll focus on proper technique,
    safe fall practices and finding our individual balance point. Come prepared
    with poses you want to work on and be ready to have fun!
