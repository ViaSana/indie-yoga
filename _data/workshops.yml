    Join John Jay for an amazing workshop, where we will hop out of the frying
    pan and into the fire of ice!

    The Yoga Sutras ask us to practice non-attachment, remembering the fluidity
    of life and our ever changing experiences. We will explore these teachings
    in the extremes of Hot Yoga and Ice Baths. With the power of breathwork and
    commitment we will strive to let go in the understanding that all things
    must pass, both pleasant and unpleasant. Letâ€™s unlock our full potential and
    power, as we find comfort in the most uncomfortable of settings!

    Other benefits include: increased energy, better sleep, reduced stress
    levels, heightened focus and determination, stronger immune system, and
    increased will power.

  description: >-
    Kundalini Activation is direct transmission of pure life force energy. It is
    a spiritual process of elevation, self-realization and awakening of your own
    divine energy. The Kundalini represents our infinite multi-dimensional
    potential. It is our inner Portal to All that is. When the power of your
    life force awakens, a complete rewiring begins: releasing all that does not
    serve you, activating all the gifts of your soul. During a Kundalini
    activation, I open the portal, creating a vortex of intensified light
    frequency. You simply open and welcome the experience fully. Through the
    shakti kundalini portal your system enters in resonance and starts to adjust
    to it naturally. Your vibration increases and you experience a return to the
    original harmony of your spiritual essence. This divine energy is incredibly
    intelligent and will purify and activate exactly what you need on a
    physical, energetic, spiritual, mental and emotional level.

    Come hop into Summer with this Fiery inversion workshop. We will begin with
    some drills around ways to get into your inversion, some wall time and flow.
    Handstands are a great way to harness your own power and flip your
    perspective. Come play, energize and learn to trust yourself. Life is play
    and this is a great reminder of how good it feels just to lean in, whatever
    the outcome.

  description: >-
    Imagine yourself being so resourceful that you can nourish your body,
    nervous system, mind, and energy on your own through the modality of Yin
    Yoga.


    Yin Yoga focuses on the often neglected parts of the body - the joints,
    tendons, and fascia. This program is an opportunity to prioritize moving
    slowly and calming the anxious, modern mind.


    This Yin Yoga training will provide you with the resources to understand
    meditation, anatomy and physiology, and the nadis and meridians within the
    practice of Yin. Whether you are hoping to teach Yin or a practitioner, this
    training will prepare you to create a Yin Yoga sequence of your own - backed
    by the knowledge of its history and benefits.
