    Ritmos del Cuerpo is an experimental-always-changing group dynamic!  As
    community we'll move our bodies intentionally to different rhythms, allowing
    us to express ourselves and create different states of being and feeling.

    We will start with light yoga. Soon, we will move our ways off of our mats
    and into our bodies in an organic and fluid way. Self-expression exercises
    will relieve stiffness (physical and mental). We will move our way towards
    the peak of our practice: intentional catharsis. Catharsis is reached as a
    way to become aware of repressed feelings and allow them an outlet. Once
    we've let those go, we celebrate through dance, we'll jump, sing, scream,
    shake, laugh; we will make no sense! We'll complete our process with musical
    meditation into complete silence. You have arrived, you are home.

    Let's play! Our journeys donâ€™t have to be so serious. 

    Bruna started leading group dynamics in Brazil, and wants to offer this
    experience as a gift to anyone who feels called.
