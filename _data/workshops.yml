- name: 30 Hour Yin Yoga Training
  description: >
    Imagine yourself being so resourceful that you can nourish your body,
    nervous system, mind and energy on your own through the modality of Yin
    Yoga. Yin Yoga focuses on the often neglected parts of the body — the
    joints, tendons and fascia. This program is an opportunity to prioritize
    moving slowly and calming the anxious, modern mind. This Yin Yoga training
    will provide you with the resources to understand meditation, anatomy and
    physiology, and the nadis and meridians within the practice of Yin. Whether
    you are hoping to teach Yin or a practitioner, this training will prepare
    you to create a Yin Yoga sequence of your own — backed by the knowledge of
    its history and benefits.
