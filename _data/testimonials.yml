      I generally like a harder class but this class really helped calm my mind
      and help me relax which was really perfect for a Friday afternoon. I felt
      like my whole weekend was better.
    class: Vinyasa 2

      Awesome flow today. Started my day off just right. I appreciated the music
      today which included Lettuce, one of my favorite bands.

      Sean is a great teacher. Loved the music and the flow. Nothing better than a full class on Wednesday evening in OB!

      “Teacher training at Indie Yoga is more than learning the proper ways to
      queue someone into a yoga posture. It’s all the space in between those
      postures; it’s the journey and dance your mind, body, and soul takes to
      get there.”
    student: John
