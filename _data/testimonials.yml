- review: "Absolutely amazing. I’ve been teaching yoga for 8 years but I’ve never taken such an intuitive, mindful class that felt so boundless. [...] It felt fun, easy going, but definitely a great workout. Highly recommend if you want to try something different and new."
  class: Mixed Yoga Arts
- review: Awesome flow today. Started my day off just right. I appreciated the music today which included Lettuce, one of my favorite bands.
  class: Vinyasa 1
- review: I generally like a harder class but this class really helped calm my mind and help me relax which was really perfect for a Friday afternoon. I felt like my whole weekend was better. 
  class: Vinyasa 2
