things-to-know:
- question: We practice Vinyasa style yoga.
  answer: >-
    Vinyasa is the linking of body movement with breath. A specific sequence of breath-synchronized movements used to transition between sustained postures. A practice that creates meditation through movement.
- question: All our classes are heated. 
  answer: >-
    We heat our sessions with precision. While the intensity varies across classes, the warmth enhances vasodilatation* (dilation of blood vessels) so that more blood is delivered to the muscles, allows oxygen in the blood to detach from the hemoglobin more easily, and speeds up the breakdown of glucose and fatty acids.

    Classes begin exactly as scheduled. We appreciate punctuality – ensure you're early to get the full Indie Yoga experience.
