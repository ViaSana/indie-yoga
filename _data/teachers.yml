    John Jay discovered the benefits of a regular yoga practice while playing
    football at the University of San Diego. After completing trainings in both
    Hatha and Power Vinyasa styles, John Jay began instructing in 2010. Yoga’s
    vast array of traditions, schools and teachers allows each Yogi to blaze
    their own path organically; something that continues to excite him as both a
    student and teacher. As Lao Tzu said, “A good traveler has no fixed plans,
    and is not intent on arriving." Currently, John Jay is helping both novice
    and experienced Yogis evolve their practice, as both Manager of Indie Yoga
    and co-leader of Indie's Teacher Training Program. Look out for his
    Breathwork & Ice Bath Workshops, as well as Wellness Retreats and 1-on-1
    training.

    Hey everybody! I'm originally from Seattle, Washington but moved down to San
    Diego to get some more vitamin D. I love to surf, hike with my dog, climb,
    camp, and cook with friends. I am passionate about the mind/ body/soul
    connection, as well as trauma-informed yoga. I want everyone to feel
    comfortable in their own skin and work to facilitate everybody's ability to
    tap into their own strength through the power of mindful movement and
    presence of breath. Yoga and other embodied practices have been instrumental
    in my own healing and wholeness and I wish to invite others into this
    spacious place.

    Yoga provides the luxury of discovering a safe place within yourself. In my
    class you will be encouraged to tune in, to breathe deeply, BE consciously,
    and move in a strategic way. My goal as a guide is to provide you the space
    and confidence to move freely and openly, with your own authenticity. In
    class students have the opportunity for lots of freedom to further move
    through their own unique needs, wants, and cravings. Come to class for the
    vibes under a low light room and flowy playlist, but stay for what you
    discover about yourself each and every time.

    "Megan has been readily and steadily riding the wave of yoga since 2012.
    Since 2012, she has moved up and down the vibrant West Coast, currently
    enjoying the sun-filled, salty breeze embrace of San Diego. Through her
    moves, Megan has gotten a chance to try a kaleidoscope of yoga styles and
    practice with some really awesome teachers, absorbing their wisdom like
    sunbeams. Although very influenced by some of her teachers, Megan walks in
    her own footprints on the sands of yoga, and brings her own unique way of
    teaching to the mat. Megan likes to teach a well-rounded class that blends
    creativity, dynamic energy, and a nice splash of challenge. She's all about
    those surf-y flows and playful transitions - but also with every practice a
    chance to give you a ride on the currents of empowerment and a chance to
    help you surf the seas of your own potential.  Hang loose, dive in, and hope
    to see you on your mat!   RYT 200 (Bird Rock Yoga, 2019)  RYT 200 (Indie

    "I believe that the simple action of showing up on your mat creates a ripple
    effect of positivity to many other seemingly unrelated aspects of your
    life.  I love to create an atmosphere filled with great music, unity in
    breath, equal parts ferocity and gentleness, and of course lots of
    deliciously sweet & sweaty detoxification! In 2017 I completed YTT at Indie
    Yoga and consider it one of the is best places on the planet. "

    "Sara's yoga journey began in 2012 during her travels in Tel Aviv, Israel.
    As someone with a dance background, she immediately felt drawn to the
    physical practice, recognizing the discipline and release it offered for not
    only mental and emotional well-being but also spiritual growth. In 2013,
    while pursuing a degree in speech-language pathology, she completed her
    first YTT, discovering the profound connection between language and creative
    expression in the context of yoga. This realization motivated her to explore
    further, leading her to embrace Ashtanga Yoga and undertake a second YTT in
    2017, deepening her understanding of yoga's traditions and honing her
    teaching skills. Despite her full-time role as a speech-language
    pathologist, Sara continues to share her passion for Yoga. Her teaching
    style is a harmonious fusion of diverse and challenging elements, anchored
    in yoga's foundations while fostering innovation and inspiration.  As she
    blends the ancient traditions with modern innovation, Sara's classes are a
    beautiful reflection of her passion and dedication to yoga and its
    transformative potential. Whether she is guiding newcomers or experienced
    practitioners, Sara's classes provide a safe and welcoming space where all
    can explore, evolve, and discover the profound beauty of yoga."
