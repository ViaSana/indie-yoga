    John Jay discovered the benefits of a regular yoga practice while playing
    football at the University of San Diego. After completing trainings in both
    Hatha and Power Vinyasa styles, John Jay began instructing in 2010. Yoga’s
    vast array of traditions, schools and teachers allows each Yogi to blaze
    their own path organically; something that continues to excite him as both a
    student and teacher. As Lao Tzu said, “A good traveler has no fixed plans,
    and is not intent on arriving." Currently, John Jay is helping both novice
    and experienced Yogis evolve their practice, as both Manager of Indie Yoga
    and co-leader of Indie's Teacher Training Program. Look out for his
    Breathwork & Ice Bath Workshops, as well as Wellness Retreats and 1-on-1
    training.

    Abigail is from New Jersey, where she grappled with anxiety and depression
    until yoga and meditation helped me gain control of my mind and overcome my
    battles. These practices empowered her to master her mind, prompting her
    athletic and leadership-driven spirit to share her revelations with others.
    Relocating to Ocean Beach (OB) in 2015, she deepened her commitment by
    undergoing transformative Yoga Teacher Training at Indie Yoga. Watching the
    transformation of the hearts, mind, and spirits while building a
    relationship with her students is what keeps bringing her back to teach.

    I first found yoga in 2014 when I was suffering from chronic back pain. Yoga
    helped alleviate not only some of my physical pain, but more importantly it
    helped lift me out of the depression I had been battling for years. I truly
    believe that yoga saved my life.  I knew that I wanted to share the mental
    and physical benefits of this practice with others after experiencing so
    much healing myself.

    I obtained my 200hr YTT certificate in 2018 at Indie, and nothing brings me
    more joy than facilitating growth and healing within others. I strive to
    offer classes that are accessible to students of all levels and abilities,
    with a focus on finding one's inner strength and connecting to one's inner
    voice. Outside of the studio, you can find me trying out a new recipe,
    cuddling with a friend's pet, or getting down to some funky techno."

    Yoga provides the luxury of discovering a safe place within yourself. In my
    class you will be encouraged to tune in, to breathe deeply, BE consciously,
    and move in a strategic way. My goal as a guide is to provide you the space
    and confidence to move freely and openly, with your own authenticity. In
    class students have the opportunity for lots of freedom to further move
    through their own unique needs, wants, and cravings. Come to class for the
    vibes under a low light room and flowy playlist, but stay for what you
    discover about yourself each and every time.

    Since 2012, she has moved up and down the vibrant West Coast, currently
    enjoying the sun-filled, salty breeze embrace of San Diego. Through her

    sunbeams. Although very influenced by some of her teachers, Megan walks in
    her own footprints on the sands of yoga, and brings her own unique way of
    teaching to the mat. Megan likes to teach a well-rounded class that blends
    creativity, dynamic energy, and a nice splash of challenge. She's all about
    those surf-y flows and playful transitions - but also with every practice a
    chance to give you a ride on the currents of empowerment and a chance to

    Sara's yoga journey began in 2012 during her travels in Tel Aviv, Israel. As
    someone with a dance background, she immediately felt drawn to the physical
    practice, recognizing the discipline and release it offered for not only
    mental and emotional well-being but also spiritual growth. In 2013, while
    pursuing a degree in speech-language pathology, she completed her first YTT,
    discovering the profound connection between language and creative expression
    in the context of yoga. This realization motivated her to explore further,
    leading her to embrace Ashtanga Yoga and undertake a second YTT in 2017,
    deepening her understanding of yoga's traditions and honing her teaching
    skills. Despite her full-time role as a speech-language pathologist, Sara
    continues to share her passion for Yoga. Her teaching style is a harmonious
    fusion of diverse and challenging elements, anchored in yoga's foundations
    while fostering innovation and inspiration.  As she blends the ancient

    My first yoga class was in a yoga teacher training in 2000. after the
    teacher training ended i immediately began teaching for the studio that led
    the training. classes then were 90 mins… sometimes i taught 6 a day. i
    started teaching because it kept me away from a very different lifestyle,
    and the idea of mystical powers and ancient wisdom seemed super romantic.
    now yoga feels like a very healthy way to be part of our beautiful ever
    evolving world of conciousness and creates great communities of people. all
