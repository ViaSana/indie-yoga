    John Jay discovered the benefits of a regular yoga practice while playing
    football at the University of San Diego. After completing trainings in both
    Hatha and Power Vinyasa styles, John Jay began instructing in 2010. Yoga’s
    vast array of traditions, schools and teachers allows each Yogi to blaze
    their own path organically; something that continues to excite him as both a
    student and teacher. As Lao Tzu said, “A good traveler has no fixed plans,
    and is not intent on arriving." Currently, John Jay is helping both novice
    and experienced Yogis evolve their practice, as both Manager of Indie Yoga
    and co-leader of Indie's Teacher Training Program. Look out for his
    Breathwork & Ice Bath Workshops, as well as Wellness Retreats and 1-on-1
    training.

    I first found yoga in 2014 when I was suffering from chronic back pain. Yoga helped alleviate not only some of my physical pain, but more importantly it helped lift me out of the depression I had been battling for years. I truly believe that yoga saved my life.  I knew that I wanted to share the mental and physical benefits of this practice with others after experiencing so much healing myself.
    
    I obtained my 200hr YTT certificate in 2018 at Indie, and nothing brings me more joy than facilitating growth and healing within others. I strive to offer classes that are accessible to students of all levels and abilities, with a focus on finding one's inner strength and connecting to one's inner voice. Outside of the studio, you can find me trying out a new recipe, cuddling with a friend's pet, or getting down to some funky techno."

    Yoga provides the luxury of discovering a safe place within yourself. In my
    class you will be encouraged to tune in, to breathe deeply, BE consciously,
    and move in a strategic way. My goal as a guide is to provide you the space
    and confidence to move freely and openly, with your own authenticity. In
    class students have the opportunity for lots of freedom to further move
    through their own unique needs, wants, and cravings. Come to class for the
    vibes under a low light room and flowy playlist, but stay for what you
    discover about yourself each and every time.

    Mae's teaching style is deep and intuitive. As a teacher, her joy lies in co-creating a space with others to explore their own unique expressions and bring greater awareness to the body and mind, subsequently influencing life beyond the mat. Her classes are heavily influenced by her work as a massage therapist; combining elements of yoga, meditation, and massage.
    Mae's love for yoga began as a teenager in New York. A seed was planted upon realizing the transformational benefits of yoga, and she began teaching in 2013. Mae completed her second YTT in 2017, and has taught and led workshops at studios, festivals, Stanford University, events, and fitness centers throughout the years."

    Megan has been readily and steadily riding the wave of yoga since 2012.
    Since 2012, she has moved up and down the vibrant West Coast, currently
    enjoying the sun-filled, salty breeze embrace of San Diego. Through her
    moves, Megan has gotten a chance to try a kaleidoscope of yoga styles and
    practice with some really awesome teachers, absorbing their wisdom like
    sunbeams. Although very influenced by some of her teachers, Megan walks in
    her own footprints on the sands of yoga, and brings her own unique way of
    teaching to the mat. Megan likes to teach a well-rounded class that blends
    creativity, dynamic energy, and a nice splash of challenge. She's all about
    those surf-y flows and playful transitions - but also with every practice a
    chance to give you a ride on the currents of empowerment and a chance to
    help you surf the seas of your own potential.  Hang loose, dive in, and hope
    to see you on your mat!   RYT 200 (Bird Rock Yoga, 2019)  RYT 200 (Indie

    I believe that the simple action of showing up on your mat creates a ripple
    effect of positivity to many other seemingly unrelated aspects of your
    life.  I love to create an atmosphere filled with great music, unity in
    breath, equal parts ferocity and gentleness, and of course lots of
    deliciously sweet & sweaty detoxification! In 2017 I completed YTT at Indie
    Yoga and consider it one of the is best places on the planet.

    Sara's yoga journey began in 2012 during her travels in Tel Aviv, Israel.
    As someone with a dance background, she immediately felt drawn to the
    physical practice, recognizing the discipline and release it offered for not
    only mental and emotional well-being but also spiritual growth. In 2013,
    while pursuing a degree in speech-language pathology, she completed her
    first YTT, discovering the profound connection between language and creative
    expression in the context of yoga. This realization motivated her to explore
    further, leading her to embrace Ashtanga Yoga and undertake a second YTT in
    2017, deepening her understanding of yoga's traditions and honing her
    teaching skills. Despite her full-time role as a speech-language
    pathologist, Sara continues to share her passion for Yoga. Her teaching
    style is a harmonious fusion of diverse and challenging elements, anchored
    in yoga's foundations while fostering innovation and inspiration.  As she
    blends the ancient traditions with modern innovation, Sara's classes are a
    beautiful reflection of her passion and dedication to yoga and its
    transformative potential. Whether she is guiding newcomers or experienced
    practitioners, Sara's classes provide a safe and welcoming space where all
    can explore, evolve, and discover the profound beauty of yoga.

    Hey everyone!! I’m Victoria. My yoga journey started 10 years ago when I was looking for a new way to move my body. After a few years of practice it became something that transformed my overall well-being. One reason I practice yoga is because it makes me a better person. My mat is a place where I have a moment of silence to nourish myself mentally and physically, so that I am able to show up for others in a way that feels loving and complete. In my class we will move, grow, and play as we recharge our souls to bring light into our lives off the mat. Come flow with me to quiet your mind and let your body do the talking :-)
