    Hot Hatha Fusion merges elements of hot yoga with dynamic power sequences,
    creating an experience that's both grounding and energizing. Thoughtfully
    sequenced and sustainable strength, without strain. The heated environment
    helps muscles release more deeply while supporting the body's natural
    detoxification process. Unlike traditional hot yoga, this class incorporates
    dynamic movement patterns and strength-building holds, allowing you to find
    both peace and power on your mat. Suitable for all levels.

- title: Hot Series (26 & 2)
  description: >-
    This class follows a set sequence of 26 postures and 2
    breathing exercises in a heated room. Rooted in the Ghosh Lineage and
    commonly known as "Bikram Yoga", this transformative practice is a dynamic
    yet low-impact form of Hatha Yoga. Designed to systematically strengthen
    both mind and body, it enhances neuromuscular awareness, focus and
    concentration. The sequence includes a balanced combination of standing,
    balancing, kneeling, seated and spine-strengthening postures. With
    consistent practice, these elements cultivate mental clarity, resilience and
    a deep sense of well-being. This class is open to all levels.

- title: Yin Yoga
  description: >-
    Yin yoga consists mostly of seated, deep stretch. It targets
    the "yin tissues" in the body, the connective tissues—ligaments, bones, and
    even joints—by holding poses for longer periods of time (3-5 mins). While
    yang styles of yoga are very popular in our society, our bodies are
    constantly striving to restore balance, which yin yoga does. Incredibly
    conducive to a meditative state, the stillness of the practice teaches the
    mind and body two valuable lessons: receptivity and acceptance. This practice
    is unheated, suitable for all levels of students, and serves as sweet
    nectar for the soul.

- title: Sound Healing
  description: >-
    Sound Healing is a 1 hour class that is based on slowing the body down,
    restoring and receiving. With the combination of different crystal alchemy
    bowls, the vibration and sound of the bowls being played together harmonize
    and create binaural tones. These tones can balance out the right and left
    side of our brain hemispheres resulting in a deep sense of relaxation and
    rest for the body, mind and soul.

- title: Breathwork
  description: >-
    A Breathwork practice at Indie Yoga invites balance of mind, body and
    emotions. It can facilitate a deepening connection to your inner knowing,
    bring clarity and strengthen intuition. It releases stress, helps with pain
    management, inflammation and nervous system regulation. Every breathwork
    experience is unique. Many people experience emotional releases and physical
    shifts.

    These shifts can be profound or be so subtle you may not notice any
    immediate shifts.

    What to expect:

    You will be taught a patterned breathing technique and then the music begins
    and you are guided into the rhythm of your breathwork ceremony. Most
    sessions have an opportunity for optional community connection.

    Recommended: blanket, pillow or eye mask

    The majority of the time is spent reclined on your back so it is recommended
    to wear cozy comfortable clothing.

    All levels welcome.
